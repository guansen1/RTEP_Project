## üìÖ System Behavior
- In **normal state**, the OLED displays temperature and humidity.
- If **motion is detected**, the system:
  - Activates the **buzzer alarm**
  - Displays **ALARM** message on OLED
  - Sends an **alarm notification via Telegram**
  - Awaits **correct password input** from keypad or Telegram to disable
- Upon **correct password input**:
  - The system stops the alarm
  - OLED resumes normal temperature/humidity display

## üì≤ Telegram Bot Setup
1. Create a bot via [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Copy your `BOT_TOKEN`
3. Insert the token into your config or source file
4. Authorize your chat ID for notifications

---

## üîí Password Logic
- Default password can be set via configuration file or source code constant
- Keypad or Telegram input is verified against this password
- Incorrect entries will not disable the alarm

---

## Display Logic
- The I2C OLED display in this project is used to visually present system states and sensor data in real time.
- In normal state, the display shows the current temperature and humidity data from the DHT11 sensor. The temperature is displayed as "Temp: XX C", and the humidity as "Hum: XX %".
- In ALARM state, triggered by the PIR sensor, it shows "INVASION" until the correct password is entered via the keypad or Telegram bot.
- If the password is correct, the display returns to normal.If the password is incorrect, it shows "Wrong password, please try again" for 2 seconds, then returns to "INVASION".
- The display operates in a separate thread for real-time updates without affecting system responsiveness.The OLED uses I2C communication, and updates are handled via asynchronous callbacks.
- Characters are displayed using a 5x7 pixel font for clarity.

---

## Keyboard Logic
- The 4x4 matrix keypad is used for password input to deactivate the alarm. The keyboard operates in an event-driven mode to ensure responsiveness.
- The system detect key presses using pseudo block of 10hz rate. When a key is pressed, the row is shorted to a low-level column, pulling the voltage down. This change is detected as a key press event.
- The keyboard scanning process runs in a dedicated thread, allowing continuous monitoring without blocking the main program.
- To debounce and accurately detect key presses, the system sets each column to low level one by one and checks all row states. After a key is detected, the system waits for the key to be released before accepting new inputs, avoiding repeated detections.
- The keyboard input is tightly integrated with the I2cDisplayHandle, enabling real-time feedback on the OLED display.

---

## Buzzer Logic
- Driven by RSP hardware PWM, Freq : 1000hz, DutyCycle : 50%;

---

## üå°Ô∏è DHT Logic
- The DHT sensor uses a single-wire protocol to communicate with the Raspberry Pi. 
- The Pi sends a start signal (low for ~18ms) to initiate data transfer. The DHT then responds with a 40-bit data stream encoding temperature and humidity values. Timing-based bit interpretation is used to decode the signal. 
- In this project, the sensor is read every 2 seconds, and when the system is not in an alarm state, the data is displayed on the I2C screen.

---

## üïµÔ∏è PIR Logic
- The PIR sensor detects changes in infrared radiation (motion) and outputs a digital HIGH signal when motion is detected. This signal is connected to a GPIO input pin on the Raspberry Pi configured for interrupt-based detection. Upon a rising edge (HIGH signal), a callback is triggered to start the buzzer alarm and update the I2C display with an alert. The system then awaits correct password input to silence the alarm.

## üß™ Unit Testing

To ensure the robustness and correctness of each component in the Raspberry Pi home security system, we conducted extensive unit testing on all key hardware-interfacing modules. The tests were implemented using the GoogleTest and GMock frameworks, simulating hardware behaviors and verifying logic correctness through isolated scenarios.

### üîî Buzzer Module
- **Purpose:** The buzzer provides audible alerts when an intrusion is detected. It uses hardware PWM for precise control of frequency and duty cycle.
- **Tests Conducted:**
  - Verifies that enabling the buzzer correctly calls PWM initialization with target frequency and duty cycle.
  - Ensures that disabling the buzzer stops the sound and releases resources.
  - Tests destructor behavior to avoid dangling state.
  - Simulates PWM startup failure to test system stability.
- **Result:** ‚úÖ All 5 test cases passed successfully.

### üå°Ô∏è DHT11 Sensor Module
- **Purpose:** The DHT11 sensor captures temperature and humidity data for environmental monitoring and display.
- **Tests Conducted:**
  - Tests proper initialization and callback function registration.
  - Simulates normal data reading and two error cases (checksum failure and no response).
  - Verifies smoothing algorithm to eliminate data noise.
- **Result:** ‚úÖ All 6 test cases passed successfully.

### ‚ö° GPIO Handling
- **Purpose:** The GPIO interface underpins nearly all hardware interactions, including PIR, buzzer, keypad, and DHT11.
- **Tests Conducted:**
  - Verifies GPIO initialization and configuration for input/output modes.
  - Tests reading/writing logic.
  - Checks event registration and proper triggering of callbacks (e.g., rising/falling edges).
  - Ensures GPIO threads can start and stop cleanly.
- **Result:** ‚úÖ All 7 test cases passed successfully.

### üñ•Ô∏è I2C OLED Display
- **Purpose:** The OLED displays real-time sensor data and system state (normal, alarm, error).
- **Tests Conducted:**
  - Ensures singleton pattern to avoid multiple display instances.
  - Validates text width calculations for consistent formatting.
  - Tests text rendering logic, multi-line display handling, and alarm/normal mode transitions.
  - Confirms safe rendering of DHT data and state updates without race conditions.
- **Result:** ‚úÖ All 7 test cases passed successfully.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Input (4x4 Matrix Keypad)
- **Purpose:** The keypad accepts a password to deactivate the alarm system. It operates non-blocking for smooth user input.
- **Tests Conducted:**
  - Tests initialization and start/stop of the scanning thread.
  - Simulates various key press patterns and ensures accurate detection.
  - Verifies the correct order of multiple key inputs.
  - Confirms callback registration and invocation.
- **Result:** ‚úÖ All 5 test cases passed successfully.

### üïµÔ∏è PIR Motion Detection Sensor
- **Purpose:** The PIR sensor detects human motion to trigger the alarm system.
- **Tests Conducted:**
  - Validates GPIO initialization for motion input.
  - Simulates rising and falling edge triggers.
  - Ensures that registered callbacks are executed correctly upon detection.
- **Result:** ‚úÖ All 4 test cases passed successfully.

All tests ran in isolated environments using mocks to simulate hardware response. This ensures each module functions reliably on its own, improving overall system stability and maintainability.
