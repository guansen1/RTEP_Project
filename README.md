# Raspberry Pi Home Security System

## üìä Project Overview
This project implements a **mini home security system** based on a **Raspberry Pi 5**, integrating multiple sensors and communication modules. The system monitors environmental conditions, detects movement, triggers alarms, and allows local and remote control.

---

## üß† Features
- **Motion Detection (PIR Sensor):** Triggers an alarm when motion is detected.
- **Buzzer Alarm:** Emits a sound when PIR detects motion.
- **I2C OLED Display:** Shows real-time temperature, humidity, and alarm states.
- **4x4 Matrix Keypad:** Used for entering passwords to deactivate the alarm.
- **Telegram Bot Control:** Provides remote access to:
  - Receive temperature and humidity data
  - Get alarm notifications
  - Remotely deactivate the alarm
- **DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor:** Continuously measures and updates readings every 2 seconds.

## Other info
- **branch**:
  - **main**: our release branch, also for code review;
  - **feature/develop**: for merge of different features;
  - **feature/xxx**: individual function develop branch;
  - **feature/test**: for unit test;

## üíª System Architecture
```
Raspberry Pi 5
|
|-- PIR Sensor (Motion Detection)
|-- Buzzer (PWM-Controlled Alarm)
|-- I2C OLED Display (Real-Time Display)
|-- 4x4 Matrix Keypad (Password Input)
|-- Telegram Bot (Remote Notification & Control)
|-- DHT11 Sensor (Temp & Humidity Monitoring)
```

## üìÖ System Behavior
- In **normal state**, the OLED displays temperature and humidity.
- If **motion is detected**, the system:
  - Activates the **buzzer alarm**
  - Displays **ALARM** message on OLED
  - Sends an **alarm notification via Telegram**
  - Awaits **correct password input** from keypad or Telegram to disable
- Upon **correct password input**:
  - The system stops the alarm
  - OLED resumes normal temperature/humidity display

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details
- GPIO controlled via **libgpiod** (not `wiringPi`)
- PWM for buzzer using `/sys/class/pwm/`
- Keypad supports non-blocking multi-key detection
- Telegram Bot API integrated with asynchronous event handling
- All modules (sensors, display, keypad, telegram bot) run in separate **threads with callback logic**

---

## üîß Build & Run
### Dependencies:
- `libgpiod`
- `cURL` (for Telegram Bot HTTP requests)
- `C++17` or above

### Build:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Run:
```bash
sudo ./alarm_system
```

    - KEY_COL2_IO = 7,
    - KEY_COL3_IO = 8,
    - KEY_ROW1_IO = 13,
    - PIR_IO = 14,
    - DHT_IO = 15,

## üì≤ Telegram Bot Setup
1. Create a bot via [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Copy your `BOT_TOKEN`
3. Insert the token into your config or source file
4. Authorize your chat ID for notifications

---

## üîí Password Logic
- Default password can be set via configuration file or source code constant
- Keypad or Telegram input is verified against this password
- Incorrect entries will not disable the alarm

---

## Display Logic
-

---

## Buzzer Logic
- Driven by RSP hardware PWM, Freq : 1000hz, DutyCycle : 50%;

---

## üå°Ô∏è DHT Logic
- The DHT sensor uses a single-wire protocol to communicate with the Raspberry Pi. 
- The Pi sends a start signal (low for ~18ms) to initiate data transfer. The DHT then responds with a 40-bit data stream encoding temperature and humidity values. Timing-based bit interpretation is used to decode the signal. 
- In this project, the sensor is read every 2 seconds, and when the system is not in an alarm state, the data is displayed on the I2C screen.

---

## üïµÔ∏è PIR Logic
- The PIR sensor detects changes in infrared radiation (motion) and outputs a digital HIGH signal when motion is detected. This signal is connected to a GPIO input pin on the Raspberry Pi configured for interrupt-based detection. Upon a rising edge (HIGH signal), a callback is triggered to start the buzzer alarm and update the I2C display with an alert. The system then awaits correct password input to silence the alarm.
